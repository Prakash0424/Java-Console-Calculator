# Java Console Calculator

This is a simple Java console application that performs basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The program uses `Scanner` to take input from the user and `if-else` conditions (no switch) to handle operations. It runs in a loop until the user selects the Exit option.
